**Experience from the project:**

I was very much looking forward to this final project as I got to use everything I've learned so far from RED Academy! I was also looking forward to working with a UX Designer and help create his unique design simulating a real work environment. 

The toughest part of this project was the angled images and titles. I tackled this part first to give myself and the designer an idea whether this was possible within the time frame that we had. I came up with a solution the next day, but it only worked on Chrome. However, knowing that I was able to come up with a partial solution within 24 hours of receiving the design, I was confident that I would be able to tackle this angle challenge. Each side in the "My Work" section has a different angle. To accomplish this, I used an odd and even loop to separate the posts. Once that was done, I was able to assign different styling to each side. The next challenge was to have the angled underline to highlight the menu. This was done through using an image. 

In the end, although it was challenging it was fun and got to experience collobrating with a UX designer and creating a unique website.
